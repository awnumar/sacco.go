# sacco.go

Golang implementation of Sacco, our cryptographic library that allows easy creation, signing and sending of Cosmos Network transactions

---

Right now, sacco.go is considered _alpha_ software, contributions welcome!

Sacco.go can:

    1. create HD wallets
    2. import HD wallets from mnemonic words (BIP-39 compliant) with a specific derivation path (BIP-44 compliant)
    3. sign transactions
